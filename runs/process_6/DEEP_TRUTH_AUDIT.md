### DEEP TRUTH AUDIT: Morning Standup

#### 1. Hidden Assumptions Identification:
- **Assumption**: The team is fully aligned and working towards the same goals without any hidden agendas or conflicts.
- **Assumption**: All team members are actively contributing to discussions during morning standups.
- **Assumption**: There is no presence of 'Groupthink' in the decision-making process.

#### 2. Forensic Proof Demand:
- **Claim**: The team's progress is on track for the current sprint goals.
  - **Proof Required**: Daily task completion reports, sprint backlog updates, and completed user stories from JIRA or similar project management tools.
  
- **Claim**: There are no significant blockers or impediments affecting the team’s performance.
  - **Proof Required**: Blocker logs, daily standup notes, and any communication channels (Slack, email) where issues were discussed.

#### 3. Opinion Labeling:
[SUBJECTIVE] The team seems to be in agreement on most decisions without much debate or discussion.

#### 4. Evidence for Falsification:
- **Evidence**: If there is a sudden increase in the number of unresolved blockers and delays, it could indicate that the team is not effectively addressing issues.
- **Evidence**: If during standups, multiple team members report feeling unheard or their ideas being dismissed without proper consideration, this would suggest 'Groupthink' may be present.

#### 5. The Last Mile:
To ensure the output is actionable, here are specific steps to take:

1. Review daily task completion reports and sprint backlog updates.
2. Conduct a survey or anonymous feedback session to gauge team members’ perceptions of decision-making processes.
3. Analyze communication logs for any patterns indicating lack of debate or diverse viewpoints.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the morning standup is not only productive but also maintains an environment where all voices are heard and valued.
